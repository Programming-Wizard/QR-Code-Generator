# QR-Code-Generator
A normal QR code generating python project

*QR Code Generator*

This exe file is a simple GUI application that can be used to generate scannable QR codes. The QR codes can be generated for any type of text, including URLs, phone numbers, email addresses, and contact information.

The exe file is compatible with Windows operating systems only. It does not accept any command-line arguments.

The output of the exe file is a scannable QR code that is based on the given input of the user. The version of the QR code is automatically changed based on the size of the text that is given in the input field.

If a large amount of data is given (100 or 200 lines), the QR code might get so big that it will not even fit in the screen of the device. If this happens, simply close the file from Task Manager or Taskbar as the close button will also flow out of the screen.

How to use the exe file

1. Download the exe file from GitHub.
2. Run the exe file.
3. Enter the text that you want to convert into a QR code.
4. Click the "Generate QR Code" button.
5.The QR code will be generated and displayed on the screen.
6.You can save the QR code to a file or print it out(Just make sure you dont close the window as it will delete the qr-code file from your
device so just maybe copy the generated file and paste it somewhere in another directory).

Known bugs or limitations:

●If a large amount of data is given, the QR code might get too big to fit on the screen.
